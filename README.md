# ReactJS-Interview-Test

## Goal

The goal is to build a react app using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
This app will return Gif results from the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/).

## Description

The app should have two main screens : 
- One with an input and a grid displaying the fetched list of gifs corresponding to the input query.
- One showing the clicked gif in fullscreen with its name.

## Build instructions

Free to use anything you want.
We recommend using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) though.
